# Diabete-Prediction-
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic health condition that affects millions globally, with a growing incidence particularly in developing regions. Early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing severe complications associated with the disease. This project focuses on the development of a machine learning-based predictive system for the early identification of diabetes using key health parameters. A structured dataset containing features such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease history, smoking status, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels was sourced, cleaned, and preprocessed using standard techniques including handling of missing values and outlier removal via the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Multiple classification algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), were trained and evaluated. Among these, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated the best performance, achieving a test accuracy of 94% after hyperparameter tuning. The selected model was integrated into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, enabling users to input patient information and receive an instant diabetes prediction along with a confidence score. The system is designed to serve as a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals and a screening aid for patients in low-resource settings. Although the current implementation is functional, further work is ongoing to enhance model robustness and expand dataset diversity to improve generalization. This research demonstrates the potential of machine learning to support healthcare through automated, accessible, and efficient diagnostic tools.
